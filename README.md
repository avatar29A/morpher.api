Russian Declension Library for .NET

As computers become more clever and closer to humans, they master human languages.  The amount of computer generated text continues its exponential growth.  Bills, emails, facebook updates... 

Many languages, including Russian, Arabic and German, have a grammatical feature called declension, also known as inflection.  Just as English nouns change with number (1 message, 2 messages), Russian nouns change with both numbers and cases.  Cases are roles of nouns in a sentence such as subject, object, tool or recipient: *Bob gave the book to Alice*.  Here Bob is the subject, the book is the object and Alice is the recipient.
